# Radiomics-Author-Network
This is a collaboration network diagram for all the authors in radiomics.

We present the relationship map in a dynamic network. The URL link is:https://mi-12.github.io/Radiomics-Author-Network.github.io/
In this network, mouse interactions are available if the reader wants to get more information from the dynamic network. For the clarity of the display, a threshold (cooperation count >3) was used in the network.

The introduction of using the visualization webpage is as follow:

Copy the link above to the browser to open the website. Then you can click on any node to see how it is associated with other nodes. 

At the same time, you can search for a specific word or node of interest to visualize its connection by using the "search names" button.

The "reset" button returns the web page to its initial state.

The "github main page" button enables to link to the supplementary materials of this study.

Thank you for your interest in this workÔºÅ
