# Radiomics-Author-Network
This is a collaboration network diagram for all the authors in radiomics.

We present the relationship map in a dynamic network. In this network, mouse interactions are available if the reader wants to get more information from the dynamic network. For the clarity of the display, a threshold (cooperation count >3) was used in the network.

The introduction of using the visualization webpage is as follow:

Click on any node to see how it is associated with other nodes. At the same time, you can search for a specific word or node of interest to visualize its connection.
